    <h1>Little Red Riding Hood: Alternative Approach - Woodcutter Hero</h1>
    <p>A woodcutter was in the wood. He heard a loud scream and ran to the house.</p>
    <p>The woodcutter hit the wolf over the head. The wolf opened his mouth wide and shouted and Granny jumped out.</p>
    <p>The wolf ran away and Little Red Riding Hood never saw the wolf again.</p>
